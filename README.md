# Vehicle Detection and Segmentation with Grad-CAM Visualization

## Project Objective
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for vehicle detection and segmentation. The model accurately identifies vehicles in images and segments them from the background. Additionally, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to visualize the model's decision-making process by highlighting important regions in the image.

## Implementation Process
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset containing vehicle images.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Utilize a deep learning architecture (e.g., ResNet, U-Net, or Mask R-CNN) for detection and segmentation.
   - Train the model on the dataset with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Validate the model's performance using metrics such as mAP (Mean Average Precision) and IoU (Intersection over Union).
4. **Grad-CAM Visualization**:
   - Apply Grad-CAM to generate heatmaps that highlight key areas contributing to the model's predictions.
5. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test the model on unseen images and fine-tune as necessary.
   - Deploy the model for real-world applications if required.

## Required Libraries
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python torch torchvision tensorflow keras grad-cam
```

Alternatively, install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-detection-segmentation.git
   cd vehicle-detection-segmentation
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook image-detection-segmentation.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess images, train the model, and visualize results using Grad-CAM.
